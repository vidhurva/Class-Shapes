# Class-Shapes
Program that Uses classes to determine the area of any polygon up to 4 sides

This program contains a polygon header and implementation files. These two files serves as a foundation for creating the triangle and trapezoid header and implementation files. Note that each header file creates a library for the other files to follow. The driver file contains the output of the program while the make file compiles every class file together. One can extend this program by adding the area of a square, rectangle or by adding additional variables to promote more sides of a polygon.
